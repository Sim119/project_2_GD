        <h1>About Evocation</h1>
        <p>
            Evocation is about utalising the raw elements of
            magic to create effects such as lighting a fire,
             or shaping water, evocation spells are often used in combat.
        </p>

            <h3><strong>Fire Bolt</strong></h3>

            <strong>Evocation Cantrip <br>

               Casting Time: 1 action <br>
               Range: 120 feet <br>
               Components: V, S <br>
               Duration: Instantaneous<br></strong>
               
               You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell 
               attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable 
               object hit by this spell ignites if it isnt being worn or carried.
               <br>
               At Higher Levels. This spells damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level 
               (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

            <h3><strong>Ice Storm</strong></h3>
            <p>
                <strong>4th-level evocation<br>

                Casting Time: 1 action<br>
                Range: 300 feet<br>
                Components: V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)<br>
                Duration: Instantaneous<br> </strong>
                
                A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high 
                cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make
                 a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold 
                 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
                 <br>
                Hailstones turn the storms area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of 
                your next turn.
                <br>
                At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or 
                higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

            <h3><strong>Earthquake</strong></h3>
            <p>
                <strong>8th-level evocation<br>

                Casting Time: 1 action<br>
                Range: 500 feet<br>
                Components: V, S, M (a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump of clay)<br>
                Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute<br></strong>
                
                You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within 
                range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 
                100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures 
                in contact with the ground in that area.
                
                The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that 
                is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the 
                creatures concentration is broken.
                <br>
                When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, 
                each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a 
                failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
                <br>
                This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as 
                determined by the DM.
                <br>
                Fissures. Fissures open throughout the spells area at the start of your next turn 
                after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by 
                the DM. Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the 
                spells area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure 
                opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully 
                saves moves with the fissures edge as it opens.
                <br>
                A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).
                Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the 
                ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until 
                the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially 
                damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structures height 
                must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning 
                damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength 
                (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, 
                depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half 
                as much damage and doesnt fall prone or become buried.
