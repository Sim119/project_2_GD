        <h1>About Necromancy</h1>
        <p>
            Necromancy is a class of magic inwhich the spellcaster has control over 
            the bounds of life and death, by casting spells to manipulate those who 
            have died or are close death.
        </p>

          <div class="ENCHANT-col">
            <h3><strong>Toll The Dead</strong></h3>
            <p>
               <strong> Necromancy cantrip <br>

                Casting Time: 1 action <br>
                Range: 60 feet <br>
                Components: V, S <br>
                Duration: Instantaneous<br> </strong>
                
                You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous 
                bell fills the air around it for a moment. The target must succeed on a Wisdom 
                saving throw or take 1d8 necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit 
                points, it instead takes 1d12 necrotic damage.
                <br>
                At Higher Levels. The spells damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level 
                (2d8 or 2d12), 11th level (3d8 or 3d12), and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12).

            <h3><strong>Create Undead</strong></h3>
            <p>
                <strong>6th-level necromancy<br>

                    Casting Time: 1 minute<br>
                    Range: 10 feet<br>
                    Components: V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave dirt, 
                    one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 150 gp black 
                    onyx stone for each corpse)<br>
                    Duration: Instantaneous<br> </strong>
                    
                    You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of Medium or
                     Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul under your control. 
                     The DM has game statistics for these creatures.
                     <br>
                    As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature 
                    you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you 
                    control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, 
                    issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will 
                    take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general 
                    command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no 
                    commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given 
                    an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
                    <br>
                    The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying 
                    any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 
                    24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour 
                    period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three 
                    creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.
                    <br>
                    At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, you can
                     animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When you cast this spell using an 
                     8th-level spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over five ghouls or two 
                     ghasts or wights. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you can 
                     animate or reassert control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.

            <h3><strong>True Resurrection</strong></h3>
            <p>
                <strong>9th-level necromancy <br>

                Casting Time: 1 hour <br>
                Range: Touch <br>
                Components: V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water 
                and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which 
                the spell consumes) <br>
                Duration: Instantaneous <br> </strong>
                
                You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and that died 
                for any reason except old age. If the creatures soul is free and willing, the 
                creature is restored to life with all its hit points.
                <br>
                This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases, and lifts 
                any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing
                 organs or limbs. If the creature was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.
                 <br>
                The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists, in which case 
                you must speak the creatures name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied space you 
                choose within 10 feet of you.
