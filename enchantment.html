        <h1>About Enchanting</h1>
        <p>
        Enchantment is the study of affecting ones mind and compulsions, 
            through spellcasting, enchanment spells can also be cast on an object 
            to change, improve, and or add to its purposes.
        </p>
  
        <div class="row">
          <div class="ENCHANT-col">
            <h3><strong>Encode Thoughts</strong></h3>
            <p>
               <strong> Enchantment cantrip 
<br>
                Casting Time: 1 action <br>
                Range: Self <br>
                Components: S <br>
                Duration: 8 hours <br> </strong>
                
                You pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a 
                tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the 
                duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an 
                unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that 
                can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.
                <br>
                If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows 
                you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as detect thoughts or modify
                 memory), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own,
                  into a thought strand.
                  <br>
                Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive
                 whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting detect 
                 thoughts on the strand has the same effect.)

            <h3><strong>Charm Person</strong></h3>
            <p>
                <strong> 1st-level enchantment
<br>
                Casting Time: 1 action <br>
                Range: 30 feet <br>
                Components: V, S <br>
                Duration: 1 hour <br> </strong>
                
                You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom 
                saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting 
                it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or 
                until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature 
                regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it 
                was charmed by you.
                <br>
                At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or 
                higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. 
                The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

            <h3><strong>Power Word: Pain</strong></h3>
            <p>
                <strong>7th-level enchantment
<br>
                Casting Time: 1 action <br>
                Range: 60 feet <br>
                Components: V <br>
                Duration: Instantaneous <br> </strong>
                
                You speak a word of power that causes waves of intense pain to assail one creature 
                you can see within range. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject 
                to crippling pain. Otherwise, the spell has no effect on it. A target is also 
                unaffected if it is immune to being charmed.
                <br>
                While the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher 
                than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and 
                saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries 
                to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting 
                fails and the spell is wasted.
                <br>
                A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each 
                of its turns. On a successful save, the pain ends.
